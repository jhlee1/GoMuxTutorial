<h1> GO Rest API Basic Example</h1>

I am learning gorilla mux.

It is the example code from the lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SonwZ6MF5BE

To run the project(I assumed you finished go set up),

1. Download mux
`go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux`
2. Build
`go build`
3. run exe file
`restapi.exe`

**I also recommend to use Go plugin, which is created by Microsoft, in VSCode**
